Hi, I am Am√©lia!

Unpretentious code witch, making software the foxy way at Ubisoft Berlin.

My current focus is on UI programming and UX. I am also expending my skill set into web development and project coordination.

When not working, I often organize workshops and game jams.

I am always eager to travel and discover new horizons, so if you want to work or talk with me, feel free to contact me!
