Unpretentious code witch specialized in frontend and accessibility.

Developing games and web applications since 2012.

I am always on the lookout to improve user experiences and inclusivity, and I thrive on interrogating Softwares impact in our communities and making our industry a more open place.

When I am not coding, you can find me organizing game Jams and hackathons, teaching programming to youth people and speaking about LGBT+ history.

Recruiter: Do not contact me! I am NOT open to new positions!
